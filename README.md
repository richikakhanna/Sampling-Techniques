## Introduction

Sampling is a critical step in the data analysis pipeline, influencing the accuracy and efficiency of subsequent analyses or machine learning model training. This notebook provides hands-on verification and comparison of various sampling techniques using Python.

## Sampling Techniques

### Random Sampling

Randomly selecting data points from the dataset, ensuring each data point has an equal chance of being included.

### Bootstrap Sampling

Bootstrap sampling is a resampling technique that involves drawing random samples with replacement from a dataset to estimate the distribution of a statistic or to assess the uncertainty associated with a model.

### Systematic Sampling

Selecting every kth item from the dataset after an initial random selection.

### Cluster Sampling

Dividing the dataset into clusters and randomly selecting entire clusters for analysis.


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
3. Run each cell sequentially to observe the implementation and verification of sampling techniques.
